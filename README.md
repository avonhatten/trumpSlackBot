# Trump Slack Bot Integration

This project is a bot integration for Slack. 

It is primarily a chat bot that responds in the styling of Donald Trump. This feature is acheived by utilizing Markov Chains
The current library for the Markov chaining is compilation I created using approximatly 30,000 of Trump's tweets and a variety of text from his speechs

There are some assorted functions the bot can perform through API's based on keywords from the user.
